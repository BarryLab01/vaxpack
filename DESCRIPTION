Description: A package for quickly analysing the diversity
    within a gene of a haploid organism, all in the same place.The input requires 
    aligned .fasta files and receive population genetic statistics in no time.
    The package is very easy to use relative to other R packages, and is intended 
    for biologists with minimal command line based knowledge.The graphical output 
    includes Tajima's D, Segregation Sites (S), and nucleotide diversity plots. You 
    can customize your own minior allele frequency cut-off point, and sliding window
    scales.
